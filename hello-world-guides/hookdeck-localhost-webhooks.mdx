## Introduction

This guide demonstrates how to recieve a webhook from services such as Resend, Twilio, Shopify and Stripe on your localhost using the Hookdeck CLI. You'll learn how to set up your environment, run the Hookdeck CLI, receive webhooks, and replay webhooks from the Hookdeck Console to test you code during development.

## Setup

### Step 1: Install the Hookdeck CLI

Via NPM:

```sh
npm i hookdeck-cli -g
```

On Mac:

```sh
brew install hookdeck/hookdeck/hookdeck
```

On Windows:

```sh
scoop bucket add hookdeck https://github.com/hookdeck/scoop-hookdeck-cli.git
scoop install hookdeck
```

### Step 2: Create and run a localhost web server

Install Flask to use as the web server:

```sh
pip install -U Flask
```

Create a `server.py` file in the project root:

```python
from datetime import datetime
import json
import logging
from flask import Flask, request

logging.basicConfig(
    level=logging.INFO,
    handlers=[logging.StreamHandler()]
)

app = Flask(__name__)
app.logger.setLevel(logging.INFO)


@app.route("/<path:path>", methods=["POST"])
def handle(path):
    app.logger.info("webhook_received %s %s",
                    datetime.now().isoformat(),
                    json.dumps(request.json, indent=2))

    return {
        "status": "ACCEPTED"
    }


if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(debug=True, port=3030)
```

Run the server:

```sh
python server.py
```

### Step 3: Create a localtunnel with the Hookdeck CLI

In a new terminal window the following command to create a localtunnel:

```sh
hookdeck listen 3030 inbound-webhook
```

When prompted with `What path should the events be forwarded to (ie: /webhooks)?`, enter `/webhook` and press **Enter**.

When prompted with `What's your connection label (ie: My API)?`, enter `localhost` and press **Enter**.

The output will look similar to the following:

```sh
Dashboard
ðŸ‘¤ Console URL: https://api.hookdeck.com/signin/guest?token={token}
Sign up in the Console to make your webhook URL permanent.

inbound-webhook Source
ðŸ”Œ Event URL: https://hkdk.events/{id}

Connections
localhost forwarding to /webhook

> Ready! (^C to quit)
```

## Trigger a webhook

### Step 4: Trigger a test webhook

Open the the **Console URL** from your terminal in your browser.

Choose a **Sample Webhook Provider** from the list of **Example Webhooks**. For example, **Stripe**.

Select a **Sample Webhook Type** from the list on the right. For example, **invoice.created**.

Click **Send**.

The Hookdeck Console will show the test webhook has been triggered. You can also inspect the webhook payload and the localhost web server response.

You will see the terminal running the Hookdeck CLI log the inbound webhook:

```sh
2024-07-09 19:06:46 [200] POST http://localhost:3030/webhook | https://console.hookdeck.com/?event_id={id}
```

You will also see the Python server log the inbound webhook:

```sh
INFO:server:webhook_received 2024-07-09T19:06:46.043305 {
  "id": "evt_1MhUT7E0b6fckueStwy86nfu",
  "object": "event",
  "api_version": "2022-11-15",
  "created": 1677833999,
  "data": {
    ...
  },
  "type": "invoice.created"
}
INFO:werkzeug:127.0.0.1 - - [09/Jul/2024 19:06:46] "POST /webhook HTTP/1.1" 200 -
```

### Step 5: Replay the webhook

From the Hookdeck Console, click the **Resend to destination** button to replay the webhook.

### Step 6: Trigger and receive a webhook from an API platform

Copy the **Event URL** from the Hookdeck CLI output. The same URL can also be found in the Hookdeck Console.

![Copy Hookdeck Event URL](../images/hookdeck-hello-world/hookdeck-console-webhook-url.png)

Go to your the API provider platform such as Resend, Twilio, Shopify or Stripe and register the  as the webhook URL with the provider.

Trigger a webhook from your chosen API provider and you will see it appear in the Hookdeck console.

Additionally, you will see the webhook logged in the Hookdeck CLI:

```sh
2024-07-09 19:45:57 [200] POST http://localhost:3030/webhook | https://console.hookdeck.com/?event_id={id}
```

And by the Python server running in your local development environment:

```sh
INFO:werkzeug:127.0.0.1 - - [09/Jul/2024 19:21:19] "POST /webhook HTTP/1.1" 200 -
INFO:server:webhook_received 2024-07-09T19:45:57.087114 {
  "to": "{to_number}",
  "from": "{from_number}",
  "channel": "sms",
  "message_uuid": "461c9502-3c2f-4af9-8862-c5a8eccf6cfe",
  "timestamp": "2024-07-09T18:45:56Z",
  "usage": {
    "price": "0.0057",
    "currency": "EUR"
  },
  "message_type": "text",
  "text": "Inbound SMS from the Vonage API",
  "context_status": "none",
  "origin": {
    "network_code": "23415"
  },
  "sms": {
    "num_messages": "1",
    "count_total": "1"
  }
}
INFO:werkzeug:127.0.0.1 - - [09/Jul/2024 19:45:57] "POST /webhook HTTP/1.1" 200 -
```

## Conclusion

You have successfully received a webhook on your localhost using the Hookdeck CLI! You also inspected the webhook payload and server response, and replayed a webhook using the Hookdeck console.

This guide provided a basic example to get you started. You can now expand on this by [creating a Hookdeck account](https://dashboard.hookdeck.com/signup?ref=curious-mints), trying features such as [transformations](https://hookdeck.com/docs/transformations?ref=curious-mints), and [filtering](https://hookdeck.com/docs/transformations?ref=curious-mints), benefitting from functionality like [configurable retries](https://hookdeck.com/docs/retries?ref=curious-mints), and generally using Hookdeck as your reliable inbound webhook infrastructure.
